Nicknamed "the Bambino" and "the Sultan of Swat", he began his MLB career as a star left-handed pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, but achieved his greatest fame as a slugging outfielder for the New York Yankees. Ruth is regarded as one of the greatest sports heroes in American culture and is considered by many to be the greatest baseball player of all time. In 1936, Ruth was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame as one of its "first five" inaugural members.</div>

              <div class="text">Aaron James Judge (born April 26, 1992) is an American professional baseball outfielder for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball (MLB). Judge was unanimously selected as the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year in 2017, and finished second in voting for the AL Most Valuable Player Award that year.[1] In 2022, he set the AL record for most home runs in a season with 62, breaking the 61-year-old record held by Roger Maris, and winning the AL Most Valuable Player Award.[2] Judge stands 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m) tall and weighs 282 pounds (128 kg), making him one of the largest and tallest players in MLB.[3] Judge is a five-time MLB All-Star.

Judge played college baseball for the Fresno State Bulldogs, and the Yankees selected him with the 32nd pick in the first round of the 2013 MLB draft. After making his MLB debut in 2016 and hitting a home run in his first major league at bat, Judge went on to have a record-breaking rookie season. In 2017, he was named an All-Star, won the Home Run Derby (the first MLB rookie to do so), and hit 52 home runs, breaking Mark McGwire's MLB rookie record of 49 and Joe DiMaggio's Yankee full-season rookie record of 29. His rookie record stood for two years, until Pete Alonso hit 53 home runs in 2019. Judge won the AL Rookie of the Month Awards for April, May, June, and September, as well as the AL's Player of the Month Award for June and September. After the 2022 season, he re-signed with the Yankees on a nine-year, $360 million contract and was subsequently named the team's captain. The Yankees named Judge their Opening Day right fielder against the Tampa Bay Rays.[42] He had his first multi-home run game on April 28 against the Baltimore Orioles to help the Yankees win 14–11, coming back from a 9–1 deficit.[43] One of the home runs had a measured exit velocity of 119.4 miles per hour (192.2 km/h), the fastest exit velocity for a home run measured by Statcast since it was adopted in 2015.[44][45] This record would later be broken by teammate Giancarlo Stanton on August 9, 2018, when Stanton launched a home run with an exit velocity of 121.7 miles per hour (195.9 km/h).[46] Judge ended the month of April with 10 home runs, tying the rookie record set by José Abreu and Trevor Story.[47] He was named the American League's (AL) Rookie of the Month for April.[48] In April, he had a .303 batting average, 10 home runs, 20 RBIs, and a .411 OBP in 22 games.[48]
              The Yankees debuted a cheering section in the right-field seats of Yankee Stadium on May 22, 2017. Called "The Judge's Chambers", the section spans three rows in section 104 and contains 18 seats.[49][50] Fans are chosen by the team to sit there and are outfitted with black robes, wigs, and foam gavels.[50][51] In a game against the Oakland Athletics on May 28, Judge hit his first career grand slam.[52] Judge was named AL Rookie of the Month once again for May. In May, he had a .347 batting average, seven home runs, 17 RBIs, and a .441 OBP in 26 games.[53]

On June 10, Judge hit a home run that had an exit velocity of 121.1 miles per hour (194.9 km/h), again setting a new record for the hardest measured by Statcast.[54] The following day, Judge went 4-for-4 with two home runs; one of the home runs traveled 495 feet (151 m), making it the longest home run hit in the 2017 season.[55] On June 12, Judge was named the AL Player of the Week. His week ended with him leading the AL in all three Triple Crown categories.[56] Judge was named the AL Player of the Month for the month of June, batting .337 with 10 home runs, 25 RBIs and a .481 OBP. His performance in the month of June also earned him his third consecutive AL Rookie of the Month award, the longest streak since Mike Trout won four in a row in 2012.[57] Judge had a 32-game on-base streak, including reaching base in every game in the month of June.[58] On July 2, Judge was voted as a starting outfielder to the 2017 MLB All-Star Game, receiving 4,488,702 votes, the most of any player in the AL.[59]

Judge broke Joe DiMaggio's record for most home runs hit by a Yankees rookie with his 30th on July 7.[60] He became the second rookie to hit 30 home runs before the All-Star break (the first was Mark McGwire in 1987)[61] and the first Yankee to do so since Alex Rodriguez in 2007.[62] Before the All-Star break, Judge hit .329 with 30 home runs and 66 RBIs.

Judge won the 2017 Home Run Derby, besting Minnesota Twins third baseman Miguel Sanó 11–10 in the final round to become the first rookie to win the Derby outright.[63] After his performance, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred stated that Judge is a player "who can become the face of the game".[64] On July 21, Judge hit a home run that almost travelled out of Safeco Field. The ball was hit so hard that Statcast could not measure the details on the home run.n August 16, Judge hit a 457-foot (139 m) home run at Citi Field that reached the third deck; he also broke a record for position players by striking out in a 33rd consecutive game.[66][67] On August 20, Judge tied pitcher Bill Stoneman's streak of striking out in 37 consecutive games.[68][69][65]</div>
